    <p>"Muqu was amazing for my UW grad photos! She was flexible with scheduling when the weather was bad on our original date, and got the pictures turned around to me crazy fast! They are all BEAUTIFUL and I'm beyond impressed!! A sweet, skilled photographer who will work to fit your needs."</p>

    <p>"At a young age, she has so much passion and talent for photography. It is admirable what she has done so far with her talent. We love our photos that she took of us. She took time and ensured shots and poses were right. She is great to work with. It is clear that she does this work because she loves it and she wants to make people happy."</p>

    <img src="img/pp.png">
    <p>"Muqu is thorough professional. She remains calm in testing shoots and lets her camera do the talking. We planned for an outdoor and indoor shoot. Seattle being Seattle, it started to pour and we made the most of our indoor location. My fiancé and I would love for her to cover our other life events going forward."</p>
