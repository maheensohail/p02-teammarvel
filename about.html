    <p>Hi! Thank you for stopping by. My name in Muqu Javed and I am a seattle based photographer. Photography is my passopn, however, I don’t believe in just taking pictures. I like to capture moments, stories, and make sure I make you feel amazing both during and after our encounter.I photograph everything from photoshoots, to events, to weddings to the little flowers and leaves in our garden. Be sure to check out the packages, and please send me a message if you have any questions at all. I look forward to capturing your beautiful moments for you to keep forever!</p>

    <p>"Muqu was amazing for my UW grad photos! She was flexible with scheduling when the weather was bad on our original date, and got the pictures turned around to me crazy fast! They are all BEAUTIFUL and I'm beyond impressed!! A sweet, skilled photographer who will work to fit your needs."</p>

    <p>"At a young age, she has so much passion and talent for photography. It is admirable what she has done so far with her talent. We love our photos that she took of us. She took time and ensured shots and poses were right. She is great to work with. It is clear that she does this work because she loves it and she wants to make people happy."</p>

    <p>"Muqu is thorough professional. She remains calm in testing shoots and lets her camera do the talking. We planned for an outdoor and indoor shoot. Seattle being Seattle, it started to pour and we made the most of our indoor location. My fiancé and I would love for her to cover our other life events going forward."</p>
